## Description

- My motivation to create an terminal application that a team manager could use to create a team roster.
- I built this project to expand my knowledge in javasript and node.js and how to more efficiently use command-line features.
- It allows user to create a roster with as many employees quick and efficiently by imputtig emloyees info without having to write or code for the DOM.
- Learned how to write tests for class constructors and use promises more efficiently and call functions within them.
